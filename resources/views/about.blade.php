                                the investor.</p>
                            <p>To further clarify this, if you invest $1000, you will receive $50 weekly for 6 months
                                i.e a total of $1,200 at the end of the 6th month, you will also receive $1000 which is
                                100% of your investment.
                                Thus, for an investment amount of $1000, you will receive a total of $2,200 in 6 months.
